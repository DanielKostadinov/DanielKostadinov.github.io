      <h3>Daniel Kostadinov</h3>
      <p> Hello! My name is Daniel Sashkov Kostadinov and im from Bulgaria.
          I'm 18 years old and now I'll be living the next few years in London.
          As for my past programing experience I have dine some coding in highschool
          on c++ but we only ever covered the basics. One of my interests is art and
          any forms of self expresion. I'm looking forward to my time at City and I
          wish to improve myself trough my stay at university.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: RandomLightning</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020).  I created a program what creates a colourful line that moves randomly with 
        the help of noise methods at the position of the mouse when the "a" button is pressed. 
        Also when the "lightning" is halfway across the screen you can press the mouse button 
        to "charge" the individual sparks and make them move differently. All of that was achieved with 
        the help of a implemented class - spark, nested "for" loops and "if" methods. Finaly by pressing 
        the "ENTER" button you can stop the program from spawning more lightning.  
    </p>
